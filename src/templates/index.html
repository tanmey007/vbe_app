        <h1 style="text-align:center">Variable byte encoding and front coding</h1>
        <p>When we store documents as while indexing a set of documents using an inverted index approach we need to
            store the dictionary and postings. </p>
        <p>The naive approach to store them may lead to large size of the index files when many documents are present in
        our data, e.g. Reuters-RCV1( the famous IR dataset)  has 800,000 documents, 200 tokens per document,
        six characters per token, and 100,000,000 postings in a postings list excluding frequency and position information.
        If the document identifiers are <math>log<sub>2</sub>800000 ≃ 20 </math> bits long.Thus, the size of the collection is about 800000* 200*6bytes = 960MB
        and the size of the uncompressed postings le may exceed 100,000,000*20*8 = 250MB.
        We can see for just mere 800,000 documents we need around 1210 MB. The internet has trillions of documents,
            then imagine the storage space required </p>
        <p>In order to tackle this problem researchers decided they needed to do something about the storage space required
        as they were aware the size of documents would rise exponentially as the time passes. Some decided they would
            focus on compressing on dictionaries and the rest decided to focus on compressing postings.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of compression:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We can store more information in cache memory as the size of information is reduced during compression
                as a result, we are able to decrease the response time of the IR system substantially.</li>
            <li>There is a faster transfer of data from disk to memory. Efficient decompression algorithms run so fast
                on modern hardware that the total time of transferring a compressed chunk of data from disk and then
                decompressing it is usually less than transferring the same chunk of data in uncompressed form.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>We will explain Front coding a way to compress a dictionary and variable byte encoding a way to compress postings.</b>
        <h2>Front Coding</h2>
        <p>In front-coding with block lengths of size ‘k’, we take ‘k’ terms in succession and front code the common prefix
            to each of those terms. Consider the following example with a block size of 4:</p>
            <b>credibility credit crediting creditor </b></br>
        <p>So for the given 4 term set, we see: ‘credi’ (length 5) is common in all the terms, namely, ‘credibility’ (length 11),
        ‘credit’ (length 6), ‘crediting’ (length 9) and ‘creditor’ (length 8).Thus front-coded entry with have the common suffix
        i.e. ‘credi’ along with the length of the first word i.e. 9, this is followed by a separator ‘*’ and then the rest of the
        letters of the first word follows along with the length of the letters of the after the common prefix,
        this is followed by a separator ‘<>’ followed by the letters of the third word after the common suffix along with the
        length of the letters of the fourth word after the common suffix and this sequence continues until all the words in the
            block are exhausted.</p>
        Hence, the front-coding of the above sequence of words will be as follows: </br></br>
        <b>11credi*bility1<>t4<>ting3<>tor</b></br></br>
        You can generate the front coded string from the original string with block size of four by
        submitting the text below - </br>

        <p>
            Enter the string to generate the front coded index -
        </p>
        <form action="/" method = "POST">
            <input type = "text"  name = "string_fci" required>
            <input type = "submit" value="submit_fci_string" name = "submit" ><br>
        </form>

        {% if fci_message %}
            <p>Original String - {{ fci_text }}</p>
            <p>Front Coded String - {{ fci_message }}</p>
        {% endif %}

        <h2>Variable Byte Encoding</h2>
        <p>
            Variable byte (VB) encoding uses an integral number of bytes to encode a gap.
            The last 7 bits of a byte are “payload” and encode part of the gap.
            The first bit of the byte is a continuation bit.It is set to 1 for the last byte of the encoded gap and to 0
            otherwise. To decode a variable byte code, we read a sequence of bytes with continuation bit 0 terminated by
            a byte with continuation bit 1.
            We then extract and concatenate the 7-bit parts.</br>

            The 7-bit variable byte encoding of a given postings list can be generate below  - <br> <br>
            Enter the postings list (comma separated, no spaces) -
        </p>
        <form action="/" method = "POST">
            <input type = "text"  name = "string_vbe" required>
            <input type = "submit" value="submit_vbe_string" name = "submit" ><br>
        </form>

        {% if vbe_message %}
            <p>Original postings list - {{ vbe_text }}</p>
            <p>Variable byte encoded string - {{ vbe_message }}</p>
        {% endif %}
